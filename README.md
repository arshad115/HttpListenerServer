HttpListenerServer
==================

Multithreaded HttpListenerServer by Arshad Mehmood (arshad115)

This project uses the Httplistener to create a simple webserver.

The webserver is capable of listening to mutilple calls.

The data(JSON) is also handled in the web server callback. 

The webserver listens for requests on the port 8000 on the localhost. 

The code also includes commented code for response and for sending and recieving custom headers in the request.
